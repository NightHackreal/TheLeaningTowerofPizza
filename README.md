## About

The Leaning Tower of Pizza is a PT fangame dedicated to paying homage to Pizza Tower's beta days. 4 worlds, 17 levels, 5 bosses. Yea.
In its current state, while it does work and is playable, it is very buggy, primarily due to various differences between Godot and GameMaker.

* Play as Peppino Spaghetti! And also the Noise, The Vigilante, Pepperman, Mr. Stick, Snick and Noisette. And sometimes Fake Peppino.
* Explore 4 floors with 17 levels! And also brutally murder 5 bosses, like a soldier bee and a mayor.
* Kill EVERYTHING that gets in your way!
* Get the not-as-elusive-as-a-p-rank-but-still-kinda-elusive W rank!
And most importantly, once it's Pizza Time...
* GET THE F%^& OUT!!!
