## Info

The Leaning Tower of Pizza is a PT fangame dedicated to paying homage to Pizza Tower's beta days. 4 worlds, 17 levels, 5 bosses. Yea.
In its current state, while it does work and is playable, it is very buggy, primarily due to various differences between Godot and GameMaker.

## How was this done?

I built this off of basiccube's Godot Tower.
